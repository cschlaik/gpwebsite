        <p>
          The Currency and Empire Sawyer Seminar is designed to study the relationship between monetary systems and imperial power, through deep interdisciplinary engagement. It is convened by Emma Park, Gustav Peebles, Paulo dos Santos, Aaron Jakes, and Sanjay Reddy. The project is funded by a Sawyer Seminar grant awarded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, hosted by the Heilbroner Center for Capitalism Studies, and is housed at The New School. Through this grant, faculty members and graduate students explore the relationship between monetary systems, the production and consolidation of racial difference, and imperial power.

        <p>
          The present Global Debt Syllabus is the last installment of public syllabi incubated or produced by Unpayable Debt: Capital, Violence, and the New Global Economy, a working group at Columbia University which began in 2016. A project of the Center for the Study of Social Difference, the group emerged out of a concern with Puerto Ricoâ€™s massive debt and austerity crisis, which exploded in 2015. The group rapidly expanded its focus to examine the history of debt across the Caribbean and then to develop a perspective on debt that is globally comparative, both historically and geographically. Over the course of more than three years, the working group also hosted a series of reading groups and public conferences, and seeded the award-winning community currency project Valor y Cambio.  </p>
