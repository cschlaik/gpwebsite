        <h4>Currency and the Construction of a Transnational City</h4>
        <p>
          An anthropological look at two seemingly separate developments in Europe at the turn of the millennium: the rollout of the euro and the building of new transnational regions such as the Oresund Region, envisioned as a melding of Copenhagen, Denmark, with Malmö, Sweden. Peebles argues that the drive to create such transnational spaces is inseparable from the drive to create a pan-national currency. He studies the practices and rhetoric surrounding the national currencies of Denmark and Sweden, the euro, and several new "local currencies" struggling to come into being. The Euro and Its Rivals provides a deep historical study of the welfare state and the monetary policies and utopian visions that helped to ground it, at the same time shedding new light on the contemporary movement of goods, people, credit, and debt.

        <h4>Cultural Anthropology, 2021</h4>
        <p>
          As cash has suddenly gone missing from Swedish life, a growing range of citizens and institutions have sounded the alarm that cash enabled a space of egalitarian access now under threat. But because commercial bank currency is gradually
          displacing public central bank currency, cashlessness in Sweden is not only threatening its egalitarian ethos but also the Swedish Central Bank’s capacity to provide a guaranteed state payment mechanism. The consequences of Sweden’s battles
          over cash-issuance may presage the future of our global banking system in a digital age, while also illuminating what is here called currency’s “tethering mechanism.” Because bank-issued currencies represent chains of credit/debt,
          exchanging
          and storing different currencies can tether and de-tether their users to different institutions, thereby offering anthropologists the possibility of mapping the waxing and waning of various dominant social institutions.

        <h4>Social Anthropology, 2020</h4>
        <p>
          This article aims to place dependency into a conversation with its opposite, sovereignty. It does so by proposing that the two concepts work dialectically, thereby casting doubt on the ideal type of sovereignty that predominates in political theory. Relying on examples from 19th-century debtors' prisons and 21st-century offshore havens, the article argues that complete sovereignty is a powerful and driving myth that must be continually contested, recognising instead that all modes of sovereignty entail simultaneous modes of dependency. Ethnographic and historical evidence can help us to chart these complex links of sovereignty and dependency, rather than elevate the former and be suspicious of the latter.
