        credit, debt, money, and the diverse struggles to regulate and manage these vital economic phenomena throughout human history. Most recently, he has been exploring digital currencies, including work on the <a
          href="https://journal.culanth.org/index.php/ca/article/view/4743" target="_blank">Swedish Central Bank’s e-currency</a>, as well as studies of offshore finance and its surprising connections to the 19th century debtors’ prison complex.

        He received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in Socio-Cultural Anthropology, and a BA from Dartmouth College. In his spare time, he nurtures an almost pathological interest in the surprising threads that bind together the works of Edgar Allan Poe and Walter Benjamin. He lives with his wife and children in Stockholm, Sweden.
